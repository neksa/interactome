% Residue-level PPI prediction benchmark

# Benchmark setup

We use observed binding site residues in Yeast structures as a golden set and predict these binding site residues using other structures.

### Dataset
Delta-BLAST E-values <0.001
Binding site coverage of at least 50% is required.
We only consider complexes that are of the same type as the templates, e.f. Homo or Hetero.

## Scores
### Our score
Distance-dependent potential, bin size = 1A, from 3 to 15A.

### Skolnick
(Lu and Skolnick)
Pairwise potential without distance dependence, applied to Calpha pairs in the range up to 15A.

### DFIRE
(Zhang)
Distance-dependent atomistic potential defined in the range of 2A to 30A.
Applied to Calpha atom pairs in the range of 15A.

### Random
Random scores are assigned to interfaces.
We use the score of the maximal-scoring interface template. Therefore,  proteins with many templates may have higheer scores.

### Binding site (bs) similarity
Each binding site in query is aligned to template. Binding site similarity is the percentage of positively scoring positions (according to BLOSUM62) in the alignments.
We take minimum of the similarities of two binding sites.

### Total sequence identity
Each binding site in query is aligned to template. Total sequence alignment identity considers the whole alignment
We take minimum of the identities of two binding sites.

## Calibration

Calibration dataset includes the original Yeast structures (by total sequence identity >98%).
So these structures can be used as templates. Self-hits and the corresponding binding site residues are, therefore, considered to be the Golden set for the benchmark.
