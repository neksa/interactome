WORKFLOWS:

* workflow.py 
    Steps:
        1. Run BLAST (BLAST-results)
        2. convert BLAST results, make a report (BLAST-results)
        3. collect templates -> ()
           load templates 
           read BLAST report
           
           BLAST results: loaded 3801383 records
           min 25 hit length
           min 15% identity hit
           min 3 aligned residues on the binding side
           min 0.7 binding site coverage


* process matches:
    - calculate binding site alignment properties (one for each physical chain pair)
    - calculate compatibility score
    - plot diagnostics (separately for homo and heterodimers) for:
        alignment length
        alignment identity
        binding site sizes
        binding site identity
        binding site BLOSUM sum
        binding site total number of contacts
        binding site BLOSUM*number of contacts
        compatibility score
        compatibility score vs binding site scores


+ calculate potential:
  process interactions in interfaces of selected NR structures
  calculate basic statistics for pairs of residues on the interface
  calculate properties of shuffled interfaces
  calculate score with 1A step from 2A to 15A - save to a file

* use potential to calculate:
  scores of all templates
  scores of shuffled templates
  score * number of contacts
  scores of matches

* generate file: Uniprot Prot-Prot pair, Gene-Gene pair, best compatibility score
  calculate Stephanie's scores for the Uniprot-Uniprot pairs #, for the Gene-Gene pairs
  calculate ROC curve for the TRUE protein interactions in Vidal set
  prefilter pairs with Stephanie's scores, Calculate ROC curve for it
  calculate ROC for TRUE interactions in Stephanie's set
  find the compatibility score threshold T

* Create complete interactome with the score threshold
  Show in Cytoscape:
    nodes with flags (inVidalInteractome, inUetzClones, Reactome reactions)
    edges with data (score_best, numberOfTemplates, inHPAprot, inHPArna, link to site)

* Calculate network properties:
  degree distribution
  centrality C
  path length

* Create website for protein-protein pairs
  For each pair show different templates and their scores
  Visualize the alignment
  Visualize the dimer structure in JSmol, show the substituted amino acids

* Think about converting the compatibility score to p-values relative the scores in reshuffled distribution

* Introduce a new score: SUBST1*contacts + SUBST2*contacts + compatibility
  Test it 

* Generate Uniprot-Uniprot pairs for human only complexes
  calculate scores with Stephanie's program
