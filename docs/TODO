TODO:
 + Fix NMR structure parsing:
  + get the list of NMR structures, recalculate them (analysis of interactions)
  + recollect all templates in one file

+ Make template modelling parallel
+ fix the two-char protein labels PDB|A|B
+ recalculate all query-template matches

+ analyze the query-template matches
+ plot charts for homo-oligomeric templates and hetero-oligomeric templates
+ write a report
=================================

 + Fix chain names in BLAST results
 + Remove 20% identity BLAST threshold
    + histogram
       + 15%, E<0.001, len > 25 aar
 + Refactor the code, so that it's in one place
 + Commit changes to repository
 + Run recalculate all query-template matches with the fixed BLAST report 

=================================

- choose the best templates for all query pairs (according to some binding site score)
- convert ids to genes
- plot interactome graph between genes
- write a supplementary website with the alignments and structural models of interfaces
!! update the report

- calculate compatibility scores for all the interfaces
- calculate the distributions of compatibility scores for the templates
- analyze compatibility scores in conjunction to other scores for sides A and B
!! update the report

- prefilter the results with Stephanie's co-expression data
!! update the report

- analyze the results in comparison to Marc Vidal interactome
* send results to Peter Uetz

- continue working on interactome project, redefine deliverables
- switch to mutations project
- work on orientation-dependent potential, benchmarking



=================================
+ Add repository for AlloDB - Enrico
+ Copy codes to Enrico
- Add repository for SPACER - Andrea
- Problems with accessing Andrea's machine
